	ls				list contents
			
	ls -l	 			list contents long version
		
	ls -a 				list all contents including hidden files

	cd				change directory
	
	cd .. 				change directory one step back

	pwd				print working directory
	
	mkdir				make new directory

	rm [fileName]  			remove file
	
	rm -r [folderName]	 	remove file and contents recursively

	touch [fileName]		make a new file or add a new timestamp

	mv [oldName] [newName]		renaming a file if in the same file, otherwise moves the file to another file

	vim [fileName]			open vim text editor

	g++ [fileName]			compiles your file into the default executable a.out
	
	g++ [fileName] -o [exeName]	compiles your file into the an executable file, but you choose the name

		| 			pipe, take the left output and places it as input on what is in the right

	To change the permissions use the following legend:     
	
	u:user g:group o:other(World)     	r:read w:write x:execute	

	chmod action [fileName]		Ex:  	chmod u+rwx g+r o+rw soccerFile

	chmod action [fileName]		Ex:  	chmod g+r soccerFile

	chmod action [fileName]		Ex:  	chmod o+rw soccerFile

	Use the minus sign to remove permissions
	
	Use chmod 777 [fileName] is you want to give complete access to everyone.

	
	

 	




	hexdump [fileName]		dump in hexadecimals  (Take every 4 set,Split into two, and reverse the order before conversion)

	hexdump [fileName] -c		dump in ASCII, character symbols

	hexdump [fileName] -d		dump in decimals

	hexdump -C -n 16 [fileName]	dump in hexadecimals and ASCII	




	
	Converting decimal to hexdecimal
	
	Simply divide by 16 until we reach zero and then take all the remainders from bottom to top

	ex: 230

	230/16 = 14 remainder 6
	
	Bring down the divider
	
	14/16 = 0 remainder 14				Hexdecimal = 14 6 = E6




	Converting hexdecimal to decimal

	Take the numbers and separate each character, each character should be multiplied by 16^n, n is the position of the character

	ex: B4
	
	B and 4
	
	B is in the first position:   B = 11 * 16^1 = 176   
	4 is in the zeroth positionL  4 = 4  * 16^0 = 4

	Add then together:   176 + 4 = 180     =>    Decimal = 180
